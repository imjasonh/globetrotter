## Actions

- **Move** - move your Rover one space ahead
  - after moving into the new space, update your facing toward either of the edges in the new space that's closest to your facing in the previous space
  - you can't move into a space that's occupied by another Rover or Building, enemy or friendly
  - you can't move over enemy Fortifications
- **Turn** - turn your Rover left or right to point to an adjacent facing edge
- **Fortify** - a Rover may place a Fortification on any adjacent edge.
- **Shoot** - identify an enemy Rover or Fortification or HQ Building within 3 spaces, roll 3+ on a D6 to hit, and 3+ to inflict damage
  - HQs count as 2 spaces for determining shooting range
  - Fortifications and Buildings are always hit (don't roll)
  - if shooting through an enemy Fortification, you need a 4+ to hit enemy Rovers
- **Build** - if all edges of an HQ are Fortified by you, you can build a structure
  - you can only have one of each structure
  - if a Rover occupied the space, it gets one free move out before building.
  - **Medic** - if a Rover is adjacent to a Medic HQ, they can Heal 1 HP for one action
  - **Space Port** - moving into a Space Port HQ puts the Rover into orbit
    - a Rover in orbit can descend into any unoccupied space on this board not bordering an enemy Fortification, or any unoccupied space next to the Space Port.
    - in multi-planetary games, Rovers in orbit can also descend into other planets.
  - **Factory** - each turn, a Factory can produce a new Rover for one action.
  - **Drill Cannon** - a Drill Cannon HQ must power up for 3 actions (they may be non-consecutive actions), then can fire on any enemy Rover or Fortification on the board, and automatically hitting.
    - each time the Drill Cannon fires, it must power up for 3 actions before it can fire again.
- **Destroy** - return an HQ building to an empty Fortified HQ space

## The Board

The board is a [snub dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snub_dodecahedron), with 12 pentagonal spaces and 80 equilateral triangle spaces, and 150 edges.

The bottom pentagon and its surrounding 14 triangles are not used, and cannot be moved or shot thorough. Their borders with other spaces are counted as Fortifications.

Ideally the spaces and edges would have magnets to firmly attach pieces even upside down, and the globe would spin to let players see all sides. I need to model this better. Maybe its a whiteboard surface and folks just draw Fortification edges?

Players start by rolling off to go first, and place their rover in an empty HQ space.

## Taking Hits

Rovers and HQ Buildings start with 5 hit points. Each time an enemy hits and wounds, remove a hit point. At zero hit points, the it is destroyed

Fortifications have 1 hit point, the first time they are wounded they are destroyed
