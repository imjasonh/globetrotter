## Actions

Players take turns performing one action each. The actions they can take are:

- **Move** - move your Rover one space ahead in the direction it's pointing.
  - after moving into the new space, update its facing toward either of the edges in the new space that's closest to your facing in the previous space
  - it can't move into a space that's occupied by another Rover or Building, enemy or friendly
  - it can't move over enemy Fortifications
- **Turn** - turn your Rover left or right to point to an adjacent facing edge
- **Fortify** - a Rover may place a Fortification on any adjacent space.
- **Shoot** - identify an enemy Rover or Fortification or Building within 3 spaces, roll 3+ on a D6 to hit, and 3+ to inflict damage
  - HQ spaces (pentagons) count as 2 spaces for determining shooting range
  - Fortifications and Buildings are always hit (don't roll)
  - if shooting through an enemy Fortification, you need a 4+ to hit enemy Rovers
- **Build** - if all spaces adjacent to an HQ are occupied by your Fortification or Rover by you, you can build a structure in that space.
  - you can only have one of each structure, even in multi-planetary games.
  - if a Rover occupied the pentagon space, it gets one free move out in any direction before building.
  - **Space Port** - moving into a Space Port HQ puts the Rover into orbit. Remove the Rover from the board.
    - a Rover in orbit can descend into any unoccupied space on this board not bordering an enemy Fortification, or any unoccupied space next to the Space Port, facing any edge.
    - in multi-planetary games, Rovers in orbit can also descend onto other planets.
  - **Factory**
    - a Factory can produce a new Rover in an adjacent space, for one action, or
    - if a Rover is adjacent to a Factory, it can regain 1 hit point for one action, up to max 5.
    - if a player has multiple Rovers, they must choose which Rover will perform the action on their turn. Having two Rovers doesn't let you perform one action for each of them on each turn.
  - **Drill Cannon** - a Drill Cannon HQ must be readied and aimed before it can fire. Each of these takes one action:
    - _Ready_: mark the Drill Cannon as ready.
    - _Aim_: announce a space anywhere on the board that you are aiming at.
    - _Fire_: the space where you are aiming is automatically hit.
    - These actions don't have to be consecutive, and you can re-_Aim_ at another space after becoming _Ready_, before _Firing_.
    - After _Firing_, the Drill Cannon must start over and become _Ready_ first.
  - **Treasury** - when a player has a Treasury, they can choose to save an action point, and use it later.
    - A Treasury can store up to 3 action points.
    - For example, instead of moving or building, a Rover can save its action point in the Treasury. On the player's next turn, they can perform one extra action before the other player's turn. If a Bank has 3 action points saved in it, the player could take up to 4 actions.
    - When a Treasury is destroyed, all of the action points it holds are also lost.
- **Destroy** - return an HQ building to an empty HQ space.
    - surrounding Fortifications are not destroyed.

## The Board

The board is a [snub dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snub_dodecahedron), with 12 pentagonal spaces and 80 equilateral triangle spaces.

The bottom pentagon and its surrounding 14 triangles are not used, and cannot be moved or shot thorough. Their borders with other spaces are counted as Fortifications that cannot be destroyed.

The spaces should have magnets embedded to firmly attach pieces even upside down, and the globe should spin to let players see all sides.

Players start by rolling off to go first, and place their rover in an empty HQ space.

## Taking Hits

Rovers and HQ Buildings start with 5 hit points. Each time an enemy hits and wounds, remove a hit point. At zero hit points, it is destroyed.

Fortifications have 1 hit point, the first time they are wounded they are destroyed
